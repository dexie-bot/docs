# Setting up Configuration File

The `config.yaml` outlines the specifications for the indexer, including details such as network and contract specifications and the event information to be used in the indexing process. For a full spec view the [explorer](#config-schema-explorer) below.


For example the `config.yaml` from the TypeScript Greeter template:

```yaml
name: Greeter
description: Greeter indexer
networks:
  - id: 137 # Polygon
    start_block: 45336336
    contracts:
      - name: PolygonGreeter
        abi_file_path: abis/greeter-abi.json
        address: 0x9D02A17dE4E68545d3a58D3a20BbBE0399E05c9c
        handler: ./src/EventHandlers.ts
        events:
          - event: NewGreeting
          - event: ClearGreeting
```

After you have set up your config file and the [schema](./schema-file.md), you are ready to generate the indexing code required to write the event handlers.

Run:

```bash
envio codegen
```

## Contract Addresses

For the `address` field in the configuration file, the address that emits the events should be used.

If the contract uses a transparent proxy pattern, the address of the proxy contract should be used in the configuration file as this is the contract that emits the events.
However, the ABI of the contract should be retrieved from the implementation contract.

If the contract does not use a proxy contract, then the same address from which ABI was obtained should be used in the configuration file.

Should there be multiple contract addresses from which events should be indexed from, they can be entered as an array in format `["0xAddress1", "0xAddress2"]` for the `address` field - or via a simple dash denominated list as seen in this [example](https://github.com/enviodev/univ3ethusdc-pool-multichain/blob/main/config.yaml) repo.

## Human readable ABI format

In the configuration you can optionally pass the file path to the abi for a contract in the `abi_file_path` field or you can specify the event signature in the event field.

After you have set up your config file and the scheme, you are ready to generate the indexing code required to write the event handlers.
An example is shown below of this feature from the above example

```yaml
events:
  - event: "NewGreeting(address user, string greeting)"
  - event: "ClearGreeting(address user)"
```

More information on Human Readable ABI parsing is available [here](https://docs.rs/ethers-core/latest/ethers_core/abi/struct.AbiParser.html)

> Dev note: ðŸ“¢ An error in the ABI or the event signature will result in the events not matching and hence may not reflect in the `raw_events_table` or propagate correctly into the event handler logic.

## Additional guidelines

- Contract name field (`Greeter` in the example above) should contain a single word, as it is used to create a namespace for functions in the indexer.
- Address field should contain the address of the proxy contract, which emits the events on the specified blockchain.
- Should the human readable ABI format not be used, then the ABI which is referenced in config file needs to be copied from the implementation contract into the specified abi directory.
