Envio's hosted service is the easiest way to deploy and host your indexer. We provide the entire infrastructure for hosting and users are just required to `git push` the latest versions of their codebase to GitHub in order to make a deployment.

ðŸ§° You can easily self host your indexer on a machine. Check the [cli commands doc](../Guides/cli-commands.md) to read the full list of controls.
